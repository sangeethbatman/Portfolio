I enhanced test case readability through BDD, executed TestNG scripts, and conducted API tests. Orchestrating the design and review of over 200 precise test cases across multiple development teams, I ensured comprehensive test coverage. Additionally, I implemented API testing using tools like Postman and REST Assured to validate the integrity and performance of RESTful APIs. Moreover, I developed optimized CI/CD jobs with Jenkins and Git for continuous integration practices, fostering efficiency in the development process. Collaborating closely with cross-functional Agile teams, I contributed to planning and executing testing activities within iterative development cycles. Actively participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings, I ensured alignment of testing efforts with development goals. My proactive approach led to the prompt identification and reporting of an average of 15 bugs per week for resolution.
